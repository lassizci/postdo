#PostDo

##A basic REST API for a daily todo list built on Go lang and PostgreSQL

This little app is the product of my dabbling with Google's Go language and PostgreSQL databases.

The project is an adaptation of (this awesome tutorial)[http://thenewstack.io/make-a-restful-json-api-go/] to use a PostgreSQL DB for persistent storage.

To set up the PostgreSQL DB, read (my Medium post)[https://medium.com/@noahdietz] about this project!

Enjoy!
